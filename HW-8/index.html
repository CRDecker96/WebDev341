  <Invention of Teleportation?>

     With the invention of a teleportion devince nearly complete, a 25 year study
     that costed nearly a trillion dollar investment has taken the world news by storm.
     Critics are saying that mankind is not ready for such advanced technology, and
     in the wrong hands could unltimatly end mankind. Yet optimists are saying that this
     is the future, and it can revolutionize trade and the world economy.

     The device is extremely complex in design, its a device that is a two part kit. An atomice wrap
     that goes over the object creating a memory of the atomic structure, once a gamma ray
     has broke apart the atom they become molecular jets that travel faster than the speed of light.
     The destination sends out a becon that calls for the atoms to be aranged just like
     they were before, only in a new place under the new atomic wrap. The process then take minute
     to days depending on the size. Size also is an issue that is still being worked on.
     The new invention will cut time, save money, fuel and over will change life as we no it.
     Although tleporting live subjects hasnt been tested successfully, because the technology has
     yet to reach that level of consistant accuracy.

     No photos have been released due to fear of attempts to remeake or give other countries ideas
     of how its made, the study headed by the US Government has already costed nearly a trillion dollars
     and the citizens of America are wondering what this new technology looks like. It could be up to a year
     before they show the genral population any photos. After the media got ahold of the news, conceptual
     drawings have been drawn up. People are also asking questions all over socaial media, wanting more and
     more information about what the techology is capable of and what we should expect in the the near future.
     Its a concept thats combining atomic science, physics, technology and exsperts are being called together
     to spear head the task, in hopes to increase the man power and have a finished product that works at a successful
     98% average. As for the people asking question, and the critics they will have to wait to see what the future will
     hold.
