-I created an article, I found it easier to complete the writing aspect and edit the text later.
-Deciding to keep it simple like an article with a serif heading body. I picked this text type due to it being article, and the font that best fits a text from newspaper, alone with weight and paragraph formatting.
-I wanted to learn the customization yet not take it overboard, I don't know if I was able to capture it or not.

##Struggles
I had a hard time with the complexity of HTML at first and to read, and reread the material a multitude of times. Some stuff still left me puzzled on some of the font size, such as the 'e'. I had to seek help from professor on how to apply certain things to my paragraphs, and to get help on how classes work inside paragraphs, setting boundaries and how to edit the whole class.
