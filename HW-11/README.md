#Week 11 Overview
1. This week I found out how to upload photos in a box and container in CSS.

2. I created a three set series of photos of random stuff I had in my Finder.

3. Created a border and padding for the three photos and I really just wanted to finish.

4. Centered everything and I'm happy with it!

5. I struggled in with understanding the containers at first but working with it I slowly started to pick up the lingo.
