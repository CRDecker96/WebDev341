#Week 6 Overview
-In week 6 i created a joke page about being a college kid, and using a video my buddy recorded we captured a snippet of what it's like.
-I created two pages, a home page and then I linked a secondary page with the video then linked back to the main home page.
-Along with that I created a contact page with a iframe of my address so fans can send me mail.
-I worked on scaling the video to fit in the page.
