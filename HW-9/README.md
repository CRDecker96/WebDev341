#Week 9 Review
* In week 9 I had many struggles with the project, figuring out a drop down menu
was a tricky process.
* I over came the hurdle with the drop down menu and its contents with help from Justine, along with persistence to make this project run properly.
* I had fun with the images, and the CSS aspects of design, creating links that give you
a recipe to cup cakes.
* The colors were fun as well, I kept it simple and fun using light colors to not over dominate the contents.  

## What I could do different
* I plan on changing this project in the future, I enjoy the visual feel of the page and using it for my final, adding a blog section, uploading multiple pages to it.
