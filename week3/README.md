##This weeks lesson:
  - This week I created a new repository so I could publish my first web page.
  - This week I learned html vocabulary and structure of creating bodies (<b></b>), headings (<h></h>), and how to use line breaks (<br    />).
  - Other sections touched on the basics of Doc typing, tags, brackets, and how to comment.

##Struggles/Accomplishments:
- Week 3 gave me a hard time with figuring out the publishing of a webpage.
- To fix my problem I had to create a new repository and organize files.
- Surprised to learn more about text in Html and how to change color, style, and font style.

##Overall:
- This week was fun writing a simple poem and I'm excited to create more and get more personal with design.
