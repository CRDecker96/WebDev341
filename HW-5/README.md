##Struggles in week 5:
-This week was a harder project, seemed like a lot of information to cover and I got somewhat lost.
-After getting a little help I finished a template for a sporting event application for a team.
-Using many types of buttons and input methods I created a form that doesn't record any information to a server.

##Successes in week 5:
-I feel like in week 5 with all the information that was covered, I understood how to organize a table of information.
-Take the information and crate a way to store it in an organized way.
-I also learned the best way to create the inputs for the information and how it gets stored.
